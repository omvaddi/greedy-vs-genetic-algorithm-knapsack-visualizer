# greedy-vs-genetic-algorithm-knapsack-visualizer

Instructions:
1. Download zipfile on pycharm and make a flask project. Drag all the files into the project.
2. Ensure that index.html file is in the templates folder, drag it there if it is not or the program will not work as intended. Make sure to import anything that pycharm asks, and then you can run app.py. A message saying running on 'http://....' will show up with a hyperlink. Click that to see a visual of the program.
3. Once here you will see the matrix representing greedy solutions and the matrix representing genetic solutions. To run the program click on the blue solutions button. Here you will see the solution that both algorithms came to
(Note) it is possible the genetic algorithm did not come to a good solution due to generations and population constraints that must be upkept for performance reasons. In this case it is possible the genetic algorithms best solution that it came to has a weight over the knapsack limit, in which case the value will be 0 since it went over the weight.
4. If you wish to reset the data, click on the blue button that says 'recalculate data.' This will reset both solutions and display new data from the random 100,000 possibilities. Then click solutions again to see what solutions both algorithms come to.
5. Repeat this process as much as you want, and when you want to finish just exit the window and stop running the program on pycharm.
